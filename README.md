## My process

  1. Started with the HTML and for the first time I tried to follow the BEM methodology, although the challenge is small and its structure is simple.
  2. Looked through both versions to take some notes for the CSS part and decided to use both Grid and Flex.
  3. Wrote the code.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Shadow Generator](https://shadows.brumm.af/)

### What I learned

1. Learned about the existence of the BEM Methodology (thanks to the Frontend Mentor Community and specially @jameslegoff92)

2. Learned the difference between a wrapper and container, although a little bit late.
The <header> part should have the "wrapper" class and all of its children should become elements of the wrapper block.
